# Question 1
See Probability_distributions_of_test_and_control_group.png file

# Question 2
I conducted a two tailed hypothesis test where the null hypothesis assumed that there is no difference on the number of REBILL regardless if the users called in or not. The resulting test produced a t value of -16.25 with a degree of freedom of 2495. Looking up the t value at the 95% confidence interval for a two tailed test shows a value of +/- 1.96. Thus, with 95% confidence, we can say that a user that must call in is statistically likely to generate at least 1 additional REBILL than a user that does not call in.

# Question 3
Similar to question 2, I also performed a two tailed hypothesis test for this question where the null hypothesis assumed that there is no difference on revenue regardless if the users called in or not. The test produced a t value of -7.30 with 2723 degreees of freedom. Thus, with 95% confidence, we can say that a user that must call in is statistically likely to generate additional revenue than a user that does not call in.

#Question 4
For this last question, I performed a two tailed hypothesis test as well. The calculated t value is 0.82 with 6 degrees of freedom. At the 95% confidence interval, the t table value is 2.45. Thus, we cannot say that it is statistically likely that users who call in produce a higher chargeback rate than users who don't.
