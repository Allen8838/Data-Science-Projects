# Question 2
I conducted a two tailed hypothesis test where the null hypothesis assumed that there is no difference on the number of REBILL regardless if the users called in or not. The resulting test produced a t value of -16.25 with a degree of freedom of 2495. Looking up the t value at the 95% confidence interval for a two tailed test shows a value of +/- 1.96. Thus, with 95% confidence, we can say that a user that must call in is statistically likely to generate at least 1 additional REBILL.
